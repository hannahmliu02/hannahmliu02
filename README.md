- Hello! My name is Hannah, and I'm a Master's student at Imperial College London for the Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovation program. I'm a recent graduate from the University of Pennsylvania, where I majored in Cognitive Science (Computation concentration) and minored in Chinese. 
- I’m interested in global AI governance, AI ethics, technological accessibility, experimentation with LLMs, responsible AI, explainability, fine-tuning methodologies, and implementing legal accountability in machines.
